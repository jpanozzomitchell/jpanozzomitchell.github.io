I constantly question everything, work paycheck to paycheck in jobs I hate, and more then I’d like to admit think my life hasn’t really started yet, even though it feels like it’s already over. In choosing to study software engineering, I’ve chosen to take control of my life. There are a lot of reasons why I chose to go back to school, but I’ll just say I **have** to study software engineering. 

I have to push myself beyond my comfort zone and really focus on keeping my mindset in this "grind mode" space because I know the life I have now is not all there is to offer. I decided that a year from now I can be in a totally different spot in my life, and know how hard I have to work to get there. Deciding to study software egineering wasn't that easy for me, yes I enjoyed participating in Bootcamp prep, I enjoy the tech community, and love the fact that I will have a career for years to come once I finish school. But for me deciding to go back to school was me also deciding to change my mindset, change my future, and finally choose myself instead of letting my struggles take over. 

I'm excited to join the always evolving world of tech, excited to create a living off of something I already love doing and opening myself up to so many opportunities all over the world for me to pursue. However I'm most excited about starting this 10-month journey to become a Software Engineer, and the career and life that follows after.

I hope in creating these blog posts that it documents my journey, the highs and lows, and will be something I can look back on to pull growth and inspiration from.
